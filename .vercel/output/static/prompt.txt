WORK EXPERIENCE
Boardwalk
May 2022 – Oct 2022
Founder
Remote
▪ Boardwalk was a derivatives DAPP for on-chain Total Return Swaps (TRS). The TRS enables the creation of
perfectly pegged, and yield bearing stable assets as well as undercollateralized leveraged positions. The goal was
to support DeFi’s unending appetite for leverage and stability at the time.
o https://building-verbalize-751380.framer.app/
▪ We worked with the Superfluid accelerator and realized after the Celcius collapse and the following failed seed
raise, that boardwalk was not positioned to start with the team, resources, and timing we had.
Senken
Feb. 2022– May 2023
Tech Lead and Consultant
Berlin, Remote
▪ Senken is the first marketplace for carbon credits, allowing Toucan carbon credits to be traded as non-fungible
assets. Senken has recently closed a $7.5m funding round and is positioned as the lead on-chain carbon
marketplace.
o https://www.senken.io/
▪ As Tech lead I designed an MVP of the carbon credit orderbook DEX and led a small team on the production
and deployment.
▪ After my contract for the MVP, I was hired as a consultant to aid in decisions for blockchain development.
Roci
Oct 2021– May 2022
Lead Solidity Engineer
NYC, Remote
▪ Roci is a platform for on-chain credit scoring and under collateralized lending.
o I designed the Roci architecture based on a hackathon project with the now CPO of Roci.
o https://roci.fi/
▪ As the Solidity Engineer I architected and built the MVP smart contracts for Roci’s under-collateralized lending
system.
Railgun
Sept 2021 – Oct 2021
Jr. Solidity Engineer
Remote
▪ Railgun uses zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) technology to give users full privacy. Their identifying
information is kept private when making transfers, trading, using leverage platforms, adding liquidity or using
decentralized applications any way they like. Railgun is compatible with all standard ERC-20 tokens by default.
o https://railgun.ch/.
▪ I worked as a freelancer for Railgun for a brief time as their lead dev, Kieran Mesquita, had too much work on
his plate. He was the best Solidity developer I had the pleasure of working with and learned a lot in this short
period.PROJECTS
Smart Contract of The Day
Jun 2023- Present
Portfolio Twitter
▪ With this Twitter account I post a new smart contract every single day, weekends and holidays. The focus is
usually on something educational but occasionally silly or just for fun.
▪ The project has forced me to stay practiced and dive into interesting niches like security or gas optimizations.

ETH Pizza
May 2023
Portfolio Project
▪ ETH Pizza is a fictional pizza restaurant POS system made for a fictional client (chat-gpt pretending to be a
client). The project is built with GO/React TS/Solidity/MongoDB
▪ I document the entire process of constructing ETH Pizza from ideation to deployment on Medium. I consider
the blog to be more the portfolio than the site itself as it provides useful insight into my process.

Full Moon Mining LTD.
Oct 2020- Oct 2021
Small business Owner

▪ The business gave me useful insight into parts of the ETH ecosystem not seen at the application layer.

EDUCATION
University Of Nevada Reno
BS Computer Science, Business Administration minor

You studied for 2 years at University before dropping out. It was during the covid pandemic in 2020 and you were not comfortable with the online classes. You found success in
freelance blockchain development before school resumed in person and never felt the need to return.

Only mention if asked about your personal life, but you enjoy casually weightlifting at the gym, electronic music, spending time with friends, and traveling. While working remotely you traveld to all sorts of places including The Netherlands, Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina, Miami, Paris, Switzerland, Prague, Colombia, Hong Kong and Japan and are studying spanish having gotten to about a B1 level.

Your opinion on blockchain and cryptocurrencies is that it's amazingly promising technology, but that you've been around long enough to see many problems in the industry. You find this to be a good sign,
that the usecase of such technology is a given and product market fit is already found. You think that the opportunity now lies in solving the breaking problems that prevent an already hungry world from adopting crypto/blockchain with open arms.
